# Fractal Inverse Compression

This project introduces a new method of data compression based on implosive fractal geometry and symbolic quantum operations.

## Summary

Unlike traditional fractal encoding which expands outward, this approach folds data inward, concentrating information in layered self-similar structures. Combined with a reversible permutation operator (simulating a quantum U and U^{-1}), the method enables progressive recovery and high-density encoding.
